    "text": "Introduction\nHealthcare data is made up of many different types of code sets. Each code set is a classification system comprised of anywhere from dozens to hundreds of thousands of distinct codes. Different code sets identify and classify different types of things. For example, ICD-10 is a code set used to classify diseases and procedures while RxNorm is used to identify and classify drugs.\nClinicians do not typically interact with code sets. Rather, they use the EHR to order diagnostics and therapies and enter notes. These orders and notes are then transformed into code sets behind the scenes, often for billing purposes.\nBelow we describe the various code sets and nuances that are important to understand when using them in analytics.",

    "text": "NDC\nThe most important piece of information included on pharmacy claims is the information about the actual medication being prescribed. The National Drug Code (NDC) on a pharmacy claim describes the actual drug being prescribed. NDC is a complex data element so we will spend some time describing it here.\nThe NDC code set was first introduced in 1972 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The original NDC consisted of 10 digits broken up into 3 segments:\n\n1st Segment: Labeler\n2nd Segment: Product\n3rd Segment: Package\n\nThe Labeler segment is the only segment assigned by the FDA and it identifies the drug manufacturer i.e. the organization that produced the drug. The product segment identifies specific information about the drug. And the package segment identifies specific information about the package e.g. number of pills.\n\n\n\nNDC\n\n\nToday, NDC codes are written as a 10-digit number on drug packaging. You typically find this number near the bar code on the packaging. An additional digit is added, bringing the total to 11 digits, when billing an NDC on a healthcare claim. The 11-digit number follows a 5-4-2 format i.e. 5 digits in the first segment, 4 digits in the second segment, and 2 digits in the third segment. The rules for which segment the additional digit is added to are as follows:\n\n4-4-2 becomes 5-4-2\n5-3-2 becomes 5-4-2\n5-4-1 becomes 5-4-2\n\nEssentially you add a leading zero to whichever segment needs it.\nNot Just NDCs - Multiple Code Sets\nThe NDC is a complicated data element to work with, in part because the field contains entries from other code sets. For example, the NDC field in a claims dataset will also contain:\n\nNDCs that have not been fully approved by the FDA\nDrug Supply or Medical Device Codes e.g. UPC (Universal Product Code) or HRI (National Health Related Item Codes)\n\nThe latter is included because retail pharmacies often sell and bill health insurers for drug supplies and other medical equipment e.g. syringes for insulin.\nOne Drug, Many NDCs\nAnother thing that makes NDC a complex data element to work with is that there are often many NDCs for the same drug or active ingredient. So answering a question like “which patients have received Drug X?” often requires looking up dozens of NDCs.",

    "text": "1.2 The Claims Creation Process\n\nHealthcare Service: A provider renders healthcare service or supply to a patient. For example, a patient has a visit with their primary care physician.\nClaim Created: The provider (or revenue cycle company working on their behalf) creates a claim and submits it to the appropriate clearing house. This is almost always done electronically using either an 837I or 837P EDI transaction.\nClearing House: The clearing house performs basic checks of each claims. For example, they make sure all the required fields are populated. The clearing house then transmits the claim to the appropriate health insurer.\nHealth Insurer: The health insurer receives the claim from the clearing house and adjudicates the claim. Claims adjudication is a process where the insurer determines whether or not to pay the claim and the amount to be paid, if warranted. For example, the insurer will check:\n\nWhether the patient had insurance coverage during the date of service on the claim\nWhether the patient’s insurance covers the particular services or supplies they received\nWhether the patient meets certain prior authorization requirements (e.g. this is common for surgical procedures)\n\nPayment Decision: Once the claim is fully adjudicated (i.e. a decision about whether to pay the claim has been reached), the health insurer will issue a remittance to the provider. This remittance is another electronic transaction called an 835 or Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) transaction. This transaction includes information about whether the claim was paid or denied and is sent back to the provider.\nCorrections: If the claim was denied the provider will work to correct the error on the claim which led to the denial, if possible, and re-submit the claim to the health insurer.\nAdjustments and Reverals: Occassionally a claim is submitted and paid in error - these claims are eventually adjusted and reversed. See the section on adjustments and reversals for more information about this process.\nData Warehousing: Ultimately the health insurer will aggregate all claims (final claims, adjustments, denials, and reversals) in a database. This claims dataset typically includes eligibility information, medical claims, and pharmacy claims. When we discuss analyzing claims, this is the dataset we are referring to. Health insurers often make this claims data available to provider partners (e.g. accountable care organizations) and pharmaceutical companies frequently purchase de-identified copies of this data for drug safety, efficacy, and commercialization research.",

    "text": "1.3 Claims Forms\nA healthcare claim is created when a healthcare provider populates a claim form for services or supplies they’ve rendered to a patient. These days almost all claims are created and submitted electronically. Often this is automated or partially automated by the electronic medical record (EMR) system.\nThere are 3 main types of claim forms. The type of form used depends on the type of healthcare entity submitting the claim.\nCMS-1500 - Also Known As: Professional claim - Electronic Version: 837P - Maintained By: National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC) - Example Form: https://nucc.org/images/stories/PDF/1500_claim_form_2012_02.pdf - Used By: Physicians, lab test companies, durable medical equipment companies, etc.\nCMS-1450 - Also Known As: UB-04, institutional, or facility claim - Electronic Version: 837I - Maintained By: National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC) - Example Form: https://www.amerihealth.com/pdfs/providers/npi/ub04_form.pdf - Used By: Facilities (e.g. hospitals, SNFs, ambulatory surgery centers), home health agencies, hospice organizations, etc.\nNCPDP Universal Claim Form - Also Known As: N/A - Electronic Version: - Maintained By: the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs - Example Form: - Used By: Retail pharmacies (e.g. Walgreens, CVS, Wal-Mart) to bill health insurers. In this section we’ll cover the key data elements present in claims data.\nEach claim form has two sections: a header section and a line section. Each data element is either entered on the header section or line section. Every data element in the header section may only be entered a specific number of times (typically one time, but not always). On the other hand, data elements in the line section may be entered an unlimited number of times.\nSee Knuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.

    "text": "2.1.1 Admit Source\nAdmit source code is used in institutional claims to indicate where the patient was located prior to admission. The field does not exist in professional claims. The field exists at the header-level, meaning there should be only 1 distinct value for this field per claim.\nAdmit source, along with admit type, is the least reliable among the administrative codes because the accuracy of the code is not verified during the claims adjudication process (other than verifying that the code is in fact a valid code).\nDespite this, it’s possible to use admit source to help identify things like: - transfers from another hospital - inpatient stays that came through the emergency department\nAdmit source codes are maintained by the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC).\nYou can find a complete listing of admit source codes and their descriptions here.\n\n\n2.1.2 Admit Type\nAdmit type code is used in institutional claims to indicate the priority of admission, e.g., urgent, emergent, elective, etc. The field does not exist in professional claims. The field exists at the header-level, meaning there should be only 1 distinct value for this field per claim.\nAdmit type along with admit source, is the least reliable among the administrative codes because the accuracy of the code is not verified during the claims adjudication process (other than verifying that the code is in fact a valid code).\nDespite this, admit type is commonly used to identify things like elective procedures.\nAdmit type codes are maintained by the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC).\nYou can find a complete listing of admit type codes and their descriptions here.\n\n\n2.1.3 Bill Type\nBill type code is by far the most complex of the administrative codes. Each digit in the bill type code has a distinct purpose and meaning:\n\n1st digit: This is always “0” and often omitted.\n2nd digit: Indicates the type of facility, e.g., skilled nursing facility\n3rd digit: Indicates the type of care, e.g., inpatient part A\n4th digit: Indicates the sequence of the bill (also referred to as the frequency code)\n\nThe thing that makes this code complex is that the possible values of the 3rd and 4th digits depend on the value of the 2nd digit. As a result, some claims datasets will separate out the digits of bill type code into distinct fields. However, we find it preferable to work with bill type code as a single field and the dictionary below lists all bill type codes this way.\nDespite the complexity of this field, it’s extremely useful. Bill type code is used extensively in the creation of service categories, including the identification of acute inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing, and emergency department services, among many others. The field is generally considered reliable because the accuracy and suitability of the code is verified during the claims adjudication process, i.e., a claim may be denied if the code doesn’t make sense.\nBill type codes are maintained by the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC).\nYou can find a complete listing of bill type codes and their descriptions here.\n\n\n2.1.4 Discharge Disposition\nDischarge disposition code indicates where the patient was discharged following a stay at a facility. The field only exists on institutional claims. The field is sometimes called discharge status or patient status. The field exists at the header-level, meaning there should be only 1 distinct value for this field per claim.\nThe code is commonly used to identify things like: - Patients that died during an institutional stay - Patients who were transferred - Patients who were discharged to home or home w/ home health services - Patients who left against medical advice (LAMA)\nDischarge disposition codes are maintained by the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC).\nYou can find a complete listing of discharge disposition codes and their descriptions here.\n\n\n2.1.5 HCPCS\nHCPCS codes indicate the services and supplies rendered by providers to patients. These codes are used in both institutional and professional claims forms. These codes exist at the line-level, meaning there can be many HCPCS codes on a single claim. There are codes for many different types of supplies and services including: - physician visits - lab tests - imaging reads - durable medical equipment - remote patient monitoring devices\nAnd many many other types of things. There are thousands of HCPCS codes spread across two levels. Level 1 codes, also called CPT codes, are maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA). Level 2 codes are maintained by CMS.\nProfessional contracted rates between payers and providers are established using HCPCS codes. These rates are referred to as a fee schedule. Conversely, institutional rates are often paid on a per encounter (e.g. DRG) or per diem basis.\nYou can find a complete listing of all level 2 HCPCS codes and their descriptions here.\n\n\n2.1.6 Place of Service\nPlace of service codes indicate the type of care setting professional claim services were delivered in. This field only exists on professional claims. Place of service is coded at the line-level to reflect the fact that services during a particular encounter can occur in different locations. Because of this, a single professional claim can have multiple place of service codes.\nPlace of service codes are used to assign claims to services categories. For example, place of service code 11 indicates an office visit.\nCMS maintains place of service codes.\nYou can find a complete listing of all place of service codes and their descriptions here.\n\n\n2.1.7 Revenue Center Codes\nRevenue center codes are used to account for the services and supplies rendered to patients in institutional care settings. These codes are only used in institutional claims. Typically these codes will correspond to a facility’s chargemaster, which is a listing of all charges used by the institution in billing. Although a hospital will use these codes to “charge” the health insurer, they have no bearing on the contracted payment amount, i.e., the amount paid to the provider by the payer. The payment amount is entirely determined by MS-DRG for inpatient claims and often a per diem rate for skilled nursing.\nMany different categories of revenue center codes exist including for example: - Room and Board - Emergency - IV Therapy\nFor a given institutional claim there may be dozens of revenue center codes used. These codes are submitted at the line-level of the claim, so there is no limit to the number of revenue center codes that may be used on a given claim.\nRevenue center codes play an important role in identifying different types of insitutional claims, including acute inpatient, emergency department, and others.\nRevenue center codes are maintained by the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC).\nYou can find a complete listing of revenue center codes and their descriptions here.",

    "text": "2.2 Dates\nClaims data is longitudinal in nature i.e. it captures conditions, services and other healthcare events that occur over time to patients. This makes claims data extremely useful for analyzing sequences of events e.g. did patients who received drug X have better or worse outcomes? However the ability to reliably use claims data in this matter is predicated by the completeness and accuracy of a variety of key date fields found in claims data.\nThe date fields listed below are the names we give to these fields in the Tuva Project, but there can be all sorts of different names for these fields in different claims datasets. For example, in Medicare LDS the claim_end_date field is called clm_thru_dt.\n\n2.2.1 Medical Claims\nTo understand the key date fields in medical claims, it’s useful to consider an example of a patient who’s been receiving care in a long-term care (i.e. skilled nursing) facility for 1 year, from January 1st to December 31st, and suppose the facility bills the insurer every month on the beginning of the month.\n\nclaim_start_date: The start date of the billable period for the claim. In the example above this date would always be the first date of the month.\nclaim_end_date: The end date of the billable period for the claim. In the example above this date would always be the last date of the month.\nadmission_date: The date the patient was first admitted to the facility. In the example above this date would be January 1st. This field only exists on institutional claims, not professional.\ndischarge_date: The date the patient was discharged from the facility. In the example above this date would be December 31st. This field only exists on institutional claims, not professional.\npaid_date: The date the claim was paid by the insurance company. This date could be any date after the claim_end_date. Often this date is within a couple weeks of claim_end_date.\n\nThere are 2 other date fields in medical claims. They are claim_line_start_date and claim_line_end_date. These date fields are less important - in fact we don’t currently use them in any analytics in the Tuva Project.\n\n\n2.2.2 Pharmacy Claims\n\ndispensing_date: The date when the prescription was filled by the pharmacy and given to the patient.\npaid_date: The date the claim was paid. Often this date lags the dispensing_date by days or weeks.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Eligibility\n\nenrollment_start_date: The date when a patient became enrolled in a health plan (i.e. insurance). Patients can gain and lose enrollment over time, so a given patient may have more than one enrollment_start_date.\nenrollment_end_date: The date when a patient loses enrollment in a health plan (i.e. insurance). Patients can gain and lose enrollment over time, so a given patient may have more than one enrollment_end_date. Patients who are currently enrolled will not have an enrollment_end_date, or they may have a long-dated enrollment_end_date e.g. 12/31/9999, which is meant to indicate they are still enrolled.\nbirth_date: The date the patient was born.\n\ndeath_date: The date the patient died (if applicable). Just because a patient does not have a death date does not mean they aren’t deceased! Many deaths do not occur in a healthcare facility and therefore are not captured in claims. Sometimes the death date is captured in eligibility data, but often it is inferred by discharge_disposition_code = 20 (this field is found in institutional claims).\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Data Quality Issues\nAs you might expect, the date fields in claims often suffer from data quality issues. For example, date fields can be missing, or the dates can exist unnaturally far into the past or into the future.\nIdentifying these sorts of problems across all the key date fields can be challenging and require a lot of ad hoc querying. We’ve figured out a good way to look for these sorts of data quality problems and built it into the Tuva Project.

    "text": "3.1 Overview\nOne of the trickiest issues to deal with in claims data is adjustments, denials, and reversals (what we often refer to as “ADR”). There are three types of claim records (original, adjustment, and reversal) and three types of claim payment statuses (paid, denied, reversed). How you model claim record types and payment statuses will impact the analytics you’re able to perform on your claims data.\nLet’s take a step back and think about the types of analytics we perform on claims data. At the highest level, we think there are two categories of claims analytics:\nCashflow analytics includes analyses like calculating Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims. This sort of calculation is done by an actuary to measure and manage cash reserves for an insurance company or health plan. To perform this type of analysis you need to see every iteration of a claim that occurred. For example, if a claim was originally paid, then reversed and adjusted weeks later, you need to have full visibility into these payments and the dates when the payments occurred. Leveraging multiple iterations of a claim is also useful for the analytics team when it’s necessary to align analytics with financial reporting, or when it’s necessary to understand when a claim was first received or processed (the original claim received or paid date).\nPopulation health analytics includes analyses around the cost of care, diagnosis and treatment, utilization, and risk of a patient population. This type of analysis is more concerned with the final amounts paid (rather than intermediate adjustments and reversals) and the dates when services were delivered (as opposed to paid dates).\nThe trick is to model your claims data in such a way that supports both types of analyses, satisfying your cashflow analysis folks (e.g. actuaries and financial analysts) and your population health analysis folks (e.g. quality measures folks, data scientists, epidemiologists, also actuaries here too, etc.). This involves keeping the multiple iterations of the claim available for cashflow analytics while allowing population health and other analytics use cases to only worry about the final disposition, which we’ll detail below.\nLet’s quickly define the three different types of claim records:\nThe three types of payment statuses are straightforward:",

    "text": "3.2 Modeling ADR\nIt’s easiest to illustrate how adjustments, denials, and reversals manifest by looking at example scenarios. By looking at examples we can also see how to model ADR claims to support both cash flow and population health analytics.\n\n\n\nmodeling_adr\n\n\nLet’s walk through each scenario in the image above. As we do, pay careful attention to how the cumulative amounts change from the original claim, to the reversal, to the adjustment claim. Modeling the amounts this way is what enables both cashflow and population health analytics.\n\n3.2.1 Scenario 1: Original Only\nThis first scenario is the simplest. There’s only a single claim, with a single claim line, and it’s the original claim (see claim_record_type) as you would expect. This claim has been paid (see claim_status). The billed, allowed, and paid amounts for this claim are equal to the cumulative amounts. You’ll see how these individual and cumulative claims differ in subsequent scenarios.\n\n\n3.2.2 Scenario 2: Denied / Re-submitted\nIn the second scenario, the original claim was denied (see claim_status), so an adjustment claim was submitted and adjudicated. The original claim could have been denied for any number of reasons. The billed amount on the original claim was $100 and the allowed and paid amounts were $0 (no payment was allowed since the claim was denied).\nThe billed, allowed, and paid amounts on the second claim (the adjustment claim) were $75, $25, and $10, respectively. Now pay attention to the cumulative billed, allowed, and paid amount columns. These columns sum up the current and previous claim billed, allowed, and paid amounts.\nThere’s one unusual thing about cumulative_billed_amount in this scenario. For denied claims, you don’t add the billed_amount to cumulative_billed_amount total. Doing so would screw up the billed-to-allowed ratio of the cumulative_billed_amount and cumulative_allowed_amount fields.\nNote that the adjustment claim gets a new claim_number and we associate this claim ID with the original claim via original_claim_number.\n\n\n3.2.3 Scenario 3: Full Reversal / Adjustment\nIn this scenario, the original claim was completely reversed and then an adjustment claim was subsequently submitted. The cumulative billed, allowed, and paid amounts match the billed, allowed, and paid amounts from the final adjustment claim because the reversal claim negated all the amounts from the original claim.\n\n\n3.2.4 Scenario 4: Full Reversal / Adjustment (w/ multiple lines)\nThis scenario is similar to the third scenario but provides an example of how a full reversal and adjustment will look with multiple claim lines. Note that cumulative amounts are tracked at the line level.\n\n\n3.2.5 Scenario 5: Partial Adjustment\nThis final example shows how a claim may be partially adjusted, with an additional positive or sometimes negative payment amount.",

However, they typically show up in 1 of 3 ways, depending on how the health insurer adjudicates their claims.\n\nScenario 1: Health insurer creates a new claim ID for each additional reversal and/or adjustment claim record\nScenario 2: Health insurer uses the original claim ID for each reversal and/or adjustment claim, but includes an adjustment/reversal code on each claim to indicate whether each new record was a reversal or adjustment\nScenario 3: Health insurer uses a combination of old and new claim IDs for reversals and/or adjustments (this is essentially a combination of scenario 1 and 2)\n\nIn our experience working across dozens of healthcare claims datasets, each scenario is equally common.\n\n3.3.1 Scenario 1: New Claim IDs for Each Adjustment/Reversal\nDealing with new claim IDs is the most difficult scenario because you are in effect trying to determine a linkage across claim IDs when there isn’t a piece of data that tells you this. That is, you need to identify new Claim IDs that are related to the original Claim ID. This can be tricky, but here are some steps you can follow to do this:\n\nStart by looking for patients with multiple claims (i.e. multiple claim IDs).\n\nTo identify reversals, look for claims where all the data elements match, except the paid amount and the paid date.\n\nTo identify adjustments, look for claims that have a reversal, then look for subsequent claims where most of the information is the same but there may be minor differences (e.g. place of service code changed from 11 to 20).\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Scenario 2: Original Claim IDs for Each Adjustment/Reversal\nThis is the simplest scenario. The payer / health plan has already done the bulk of the work for you - explicitly telling you which claims were adjusted / reversed and whether the claim was paid or denied. However in practice this information is usually not completely available, so like most things in healthcare data there tends to be a bit of detective work to fill in the gaps.\n\n\n3.3.3 Scenario 3: Combination New and Original Claim IDs for Each Adjustment/Reversal\nSometimes adjustments and reversals will appear as new claim IDs, but these claim IDs will include the original claim ID plus some additional characters. For example:\n\noriginal claim ID: A1234\nadjustment claims ID: A12341\nreversal claim ID: A12342\n\nIn this example you can see the subsequent claims have an integer appended to them.",

    "text": "3.4 Real-world Impacts of ADRs\nIn an ideal world, all population health analytics should be based on a claims dataset that represents the true set of services rendered by the provider to the patient and payments rendered by the health insurer to the provider. However, unless you account and correct for claims adjustments and reversals in raw claims data, you are including records in your analysis for services that may never have been delivered. The problem with downstream analytics is much more on the utilization side than on the payments side.\nPayments\nLet’s start by exploring the impact on payments first, since it is minimal and more straightforward. At the end of the day, claims adjustments and reversals will directly flow through to aggregate payment amounts (e.g. payments aggregated to PMPM level), generating the true/correct payment statistics. For example, if a claim was submitted in error and then later a reversal was submitted, the sum of the paid amount for these two claims will be zero, which is the true paid amount we would expect. As this example demonstrates, the aggregate payment amounts in any analysis (e.g. trending total medical PMPM by month) will be correct by default, without any changes made to the raw claims data. Therefore, it’s not usually necessary to identify and correct adjustments, reversals, or denials before calculating payment statistics.\nUtilization\nHowever, the impact on utilization analytics is not as straightforward. In the simple example above we noticed that the place of service code changed from 11 (office visit) to 20 (urgent care). Place of service code is an important piece of information used to group claims into encounters. Without taking into account that a reversal and adjustment was made for this claim, it looks like two place of service codes exist for the same visit, and we are unsure which code to use to assign an encounter type to the claim (i.e. should the claim be labeled an office visit or urgent care visit).\nThis has serious consequences for utilization analytics and also impacts payment analytics if we want to analyze payments by care setting. For example, suppose we are interested in looking at spend across different care settings, e.g., acute inpatient, inpatient rehab, emergency department, urgent care, and office visit. Without properly identifying and correcting claims adjustments and reversals we won’t be able to bucket spend or number of visits in the appropriate category.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "5.1 Overview\nWhen trending population level statistics such as claims payments or utilization, it’s often best to normalize for changes in patient enrollment i.e. eligibility. The common way to do this is by computing member months and using this as the denominator. Statistics that have been normalized changes in members months are often reported as “per-member-per-month” or “PMPM”. For example, one would typically look at ED visits PMPM.\nIn case it isn’t obvious, the reason it’s a best practice to normalize for changes in enrollment when trending these sorts of statistics is because things like claims payments and utilization will change month-to-month simply because the eligible population changes as members gain/lose eligibility due to changes in employment, birth, death, etc.\nThe process of calculating PMPM requires assigning claims to a particular member month. The two date fields most commonly used to do this are claim_start_date and claim_end_date. Paid_date is less commonly used because doing so will include variation due to claims adjudication e.g. adjustments that occur for some claims over time. Sometimes this is desired, but for most analyses it’s more common to take the date from when the healthcare encounter occurred.\nUsing claim_start_date will often lead to slightly different results than claim_end_date, though the difference is often small. Although there is no hard rule, it’s more common to use claim_start_date, the thinking being that if a patient loses eligibility during a long encounter, the insurer who covered the patient at the beginning of the encounter is more likely to pay. However we haven’t seen much hard evidence supporting this hypothesis and our current use of claim_start_date is more out of convention than anything else.",

    "section": "5.2 Calculating Member Months",
    "text": "5.2 Calculating Member Months\nIn this section we use an example to describe how to calculate member months. This is the same methodology we use in the Tuva Project.\nTo calculate member months, you need to convert each patient’s eligibility record (with start and end dates) into multiple records, with one record for each month of eligibility. Let’s take an example. Suppose member A1234 has coverage from Aetna from January 1st to June 15th of 2022. They lose coverage on June 16th and they regain coverage on August 10th. Further suppose member B2468 has coverage from January 1st through the entire year of 2022. These two members would have eligibility spans that look like the data below:\n\n\n\nperson_id\npayer\nenrollment_start_date\nenrollment_end_date\n\n\n\n\nA1234\nAetna\n01-01-2022\n06-15-2022\n\n\nA1234\nAetna\n08-10-2022\n\n\n\nB2468\nAetna\n01-01-2022\n12-31-2022\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s suppose the current date is January 31st 2023.\nIn this example, patient B2468 has an enrollment span with 12 months of continuous eligibility, and so should be counted as having 12 member months. And it turns out that A1234 should also be counted as having 12 member months, but the assignment isn’t as straightforward. To unpack it, we need to take a brief detour into partial eligibility.\nPartial eligibility occurs whenever a patient does not have eligibility for an entire month. A1234 has partial eligibility for the months of June 2022 and August 2022. There are multiple methods for handling partial eligibility when computing member months, but the most common method is to assume full eligibility for the entire month. Not every type of health insurance coverage works like this, but the majority do. In the example above we would give A1234 a full member month for both June 2022 and August 2022, following this method.\n\n\n \nAfter converting the above enrollment spans to member months (e.g. by using the SQL at the end of this section), the data would look like this:\n\n\n\nperson_id\nyear_month\npayer\n\n\n\n\nA1234\n2022-01\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-02\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-03\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-04\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-05\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-06\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-08\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-09\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-10\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-11\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2022-12\nAetna\n\n\nA1234\n2023-01\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-01\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-02\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-03\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-04\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-05\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-06\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-07\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-08\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-09\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-10\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-11\nAetna\n\n\nB2468\n2022-12\nAetna\n\n\n\nNotice that the last member month given to patient A1234 was for January 2023, since we supposed the present date was January 31st 2023 in our example.",

Because all subcategories roll up to one and only one higher level category, the sum of all the logic for each subcategory in a category is the same as the logic for the category. As such, we’ll describe the higher level categories conceptually without codes, and then we’ll define each subcategory sharing the code sets.

    "text": "9.1 Overview\nHospital readmissions are one of the most common healthcare concepts. They are also one of the most complicated concepts to define and implement as code. Here we provide a general overview of how to calculate a hospital readmission measure.\nThere are many different ways to define hospital readmission measures. However every readmission measure is built on two underlying concepts: the index admission and the readmission. The index admission is a hospitalization that qualifies to be included in the readmission measure. Not all hospitalizations will meet the criteria to be index admissions and will therefore not be included in the readmission measure. For example, if a patient dies during a hospitalization, that hospitalization will not be an index admission, and will not be included in the readmission measure. There are many more pieces of logic to define if a hospitalization counts as an index admission for each different readmission measure. For example, hospitalizations for medical treatment of cancer are not index admissions. We explain each piece of logic further below.\nTo better understand these fundamental concepts, it is helpful to think of building a readmission measure as follows:\nThe index admission (index_admit_flag) and readmission (readmit_flag) are then used to compute the readmission measure. The sum of the index_admit_flag column forms the denominator of the readmission measure while the sum of the readmit_flag column forms the numerator. In the example data table above there are 3 total inpatient admissions, 2 index admissions, and 1 readmission, resulting in a 50% readmission rate.\nThe different definitions of readmission measures are simply variations in the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria that define the index_admit_flag and the readmit_flag. The most commonly used readmission measures are the CMS readmission measures.\nThere are 7 such measures grouped into 3 categories:",

    "section": "9.2 CMS Readmissions Algorithm",
    "text": "9.2 CMS Readmissions Algorithm\nThe All-cause Hospital-wide Readmission Measure (“Hospital-wide Measure”) is the most commonly used readmission measure definition of all. The sections that follow describe how to define and implement the Hospital-wide Measure on EHR data or claims data in your data warehouse. This measure has also been encoded into the Tuva Project, including all necessary terminology datasets and data quality tests.\n\n9.2.1 Data Requirements\nThe Hospital-wide Measure can be implemented on either EHR data or claims data. Strictly speaking, CMS developed the Hospital-wide Measure to run on Medicare FFS claims data, but CMS explicitly states in their documentation that the measure may be adapted to run against an all-payer patient population.\nThe data elements needed to process the readmission measure are listed below.\n\npatient\n\nperson_id\ngender\nbirth_date\n\nencounter\n\nencounter_id\nperson_id\nencounter_start_date\nencounter_end_date\ndischarge_disposition_code\nlocation\nms_drg\nencounter_type\n\ncondition\n\nencounter_id\ncode\ndiagnosis_rank\ncode_type\ncondition_type\n\nprocedure\n\nencounter_id\nprocedure_code\ncode_type\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Terminology Datasets\nThe Hospital-wide Measure requires several terminology datasets that are used as lookup tables to create the index admission and readmission. The following is a complete list of the terminology datasets that are needed:\n\n\n\nTerminology Datasets\n\n\nCMS makes these terminology datasets available as files on the quality net website. The links below download two Excel spreadsheets that include all the terminology datasets listed above. - https://qualitynet.cms.gov/files/60943ca9fd340b002259fe16?filename=2021_HWR.xlsx - https://qualitynet.cms.gov/files/6092ab86fd340b002259fda0?filename=YaleMod_CCS_PCS_CM_Map_v2020.xlsx\nThese terminology datasets are already included in the Tuva Project.\n\n\n9.2.3 Index Admission Algorithm\nThe index admission algorithm is the set of sub-algorithms (i.e. rules) that together determine whether an inpatient admission qualifies as an index admission (i.e. receives an index_admit_flag = 1 or 0). Not every inpatient admission qualifies as an index admission.\nHere are the sub-algorithms used by the Hospital-wide Measure:\n\nCohort Inclusion Algorithm\nCohort Exclusion Algorithm\nDischarged Alive and Not Against Medical Advice\nNot a Transfer\nNot a Same Day Readmission\nRun-out\n\nIf an inpatient admission meets the criteria from all of these sub-algorithms then it qualifies as an index admission. Otherwise it does not. Below we walk through each sub-algorithm.\n\n\n9.2.4 Cohort Inclusion Algorithm\nThe cohort inclusion algorithm is a set of rules that determine whether an inpatient admission belongs to 1 or more specialty categories. In order to qualify as an index admission, an inpatient admission must belong to 1 or more of these 5 specialty categories:\n\nMedicine\nCardiorespiratory\nCardiovascular\nNeurology\nSurgery / Gynecology\n\nHere are the steps to implement the cohort inclusion algorithm:\n\nEach inpatient admission should have 1 primary ICD-10-CM diagnosis code and 0 or more ICD-10-PCS procedure codes associated with it.\nMap each of these codes to the custom CCS Condition Categories (terminology datasets #8 and #9). Now each inpatient admission should have its corresponding CCS diagnosis and procedure categories assigned.\nFor each inpatient admission, map its assigned CCS diagnosis and procedure categories to those listed in the HWR Specialty Cohort Inclusion terminology dataset (terminology dataset #1) to determine if it should be assigned to any of the first 4 specialty categories (medicine, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology).\nFor each inpatient admission, map its ICD-10-PCS codes to those listed in the HWR Surg-Gyn Cohort Inclusion terminology dataset (terminology dataset #2) to determine if the readmission should be assigned to the Surgical / Gynecology specialty category.\nInpatient admissions are successfully assigned to one or more specialty categories based on steps 3 and 4 pass this algorithm. Otherwise the admission fails and is no longer a candidate for an index admission.\n\nHere is a diagram of the cohort inclusion algorithm:\n\n\n\nCohort Inclusion Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n9.2.5 Cohort Exclusion Algorithm\nAn inpatient admission does not qualify as an index admission if the primary reason for the index admission was related to cancer, rehabilitation, or mental health. These categories are defined in the HWR Cohort Exclusion terminology dataset (terminology dataset #3). In order to use this dataset, first map all primary ICD-10-CM codes to the Custom CCS mapping dataset and then lookup whether each inpatient admission had any of these CCS condition categories.\nInpatient admissions that do not map to any of these CCS condition categories pass this criteria for inclusion as an index admission.\n\n\n9.2.6 Discharged Alive and Not Against Medical Advice\nIn order to qualify as an index admission the inpatient admission must not have a discharge status of 20 (‘expired’) or 07 (‘left against medical advice’).\n\n\n9.2.7 Not a Transfer\nInpatient admissions that result in the patient being transferred to another acute care facility do not count as index admissions. However, the subsequent transfer does count as an index admission if:\n\nThe patient is discharged alive and not against medical advice\nThe patient is discharged to a non-acute care setting (e.g. home, SNF, etc.)\n\nImportantly, the transfer does not necessarily have to meet the other index admission criteria. For example, the transfer does not have to pass the cohort inclusion algorithm as long as the initial admission does.\nA transfer is defined as occurring if a patient is discharged from an acute care hospital and admitted to another acute care hospital on the same day or the following day. No other criteria such as discharge status or admit source is required to define a transfer.\n\n\n9.2.8 Not a Same-day Readmission\nAn inpatient admission is not considered an index admission if the patient is readmitted to the same hospital on the same day they were discharged from a previous admission for the same condition. In this situation, the readmission itself qualifies as the index admission.\n\n\n9.2.9 Run-out\nIn order to qualify as an index admission, the admission must occur at least 30 days before the last date of discharge in the dataset.\nFor example, suppose your dataset contains inpatient admissions that occurred in calendar year 2018. Without this rule, admissions in this dataset that occurred on the last date in the dataset (i.e. December 31, 2018) could be flagged as index admissions but would never have an associated readmission because the data does not exist. As a result the readmission measure for the month of December 2018 would be artificially low (there would be a typical number of index admissions but fewer than typical readmissions simply because the data does not exist).\n\n\n9.2.10 Planned Admission Algorithm\nThe planned readmission algorithm is used to exclude planned admissions from being flagged as readmissions in the Hospital-wide Measure. Terminology datasets #4-7 are used in this algorithm.\nHere are the steps to implement the algorithm:\n\nThis algorithm requires mapping the primary ICD-10-CM code to the custom CCS diagnosis categories and all the ICD-10-PCS codes to the custom CCS procedure categories for each inpatient admission (terminology datasets #8 and #9).\nFor each inpatient admission, check whether the CCS diagnosis and procedure categories fall under the “always planned” list of diagnoses and procedures (terminology datasets #4 and #5). If any match occurs, this is a planned admission.\nFor each inpatient admission, check whether the CCS procedure categories and ICD-10-PCS codes fall under the list of potentially planned procedures (terminology dataset #6). If any match occurs, check whether this patient had any primary ICD-10-CM code or CCS diagnosis category that is considered an “always acute” code (terminology dataset #7). If the answer is no, this is a planned admission.\nInpatient admissions that do not qualify as planned admissions based on steps #2 and #3 above are considered unplanned.\n\nHere is a diagram of the algorithm:\n\n\n\nPlanned Admission Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n9.2.11 Unplanned Readmission Algorithm\nAn admission that occurs within 30 days of an index admission is considered a readmission if it meets the criteria below:\n\nNot a Planned Readmission\nDoes Not Follow a Planned Readmission\nNot a Multiple Readmission\n\nPlanned readmissions are excluded from the readmission measure, as described in the previous section.\nIn a chain of readmissions, where the planned readmission occurs before an unplanned readmission, the unplanned readmission does not qualify as a readmission.\n\n\n\nUnplanned Readmission 1\n\n\nIn a chain of readmissions, where two or more unplanned readmissions follow an index admission, only the first unplanned readmission qualifies as a readmission. This is because the readmission flag is binary.\n\n\n\nUnplanned Readmission 2",

[1]\nAt a high level, if a patient is sicker or has higher predicted medical cost, the payer insuring that patient will be compensated more.\nA Risk Adjustment Factor Score (“RAF score”) is a measure of the estimated cost of an individual’s care based on demographic factors such as age and gender and their associated disease factors (how costly/sick is the individual patient). This RAF score is then used to calculate payments or reimbursements to these organizations.\nThere are multiple risk adjustment models that exist for both Medicare patients and commercial patients.

    "text": "10.4 FAQ\n\n10.4.0.1 What does zero-sum mean?\nZero-sum in the context of commercial risk adjustment (HHS-HCC Model) means that there is no government subsidization for private companies in the risk adjustment process. If the illness burden of a state in total increases from the prior year, the government provides no additional funds. What happens during reconciliation is some health insurance companies will have to pay into a pool because they have healthier than average patients. Some organizations will get paid out from that pool because they have sicker than average patients. The total transfer of dollars adds up to $0.\n\n\n10.4.0.2 If risk scores inform payments, how are risk scores checked to make sure they are not overinflated?\nBoth HHS-HCC and CMS-HCC models go through a validation process which is called “Risk Adjustment Data Validation” (aka RADV). The RADV processes and procedures are different for different risk adjustment models.\n\n\n10.4.0.3 Can you compare risk scores between years to see the illness burden of a patient change over time?\nThis can be done, but is not recommended, especially if using different risk adjustment models between different years. There may be other models that can more accurately reflect illness burden, and risk adjustment is mainly focused on predicted medical expenditure. These two things are correlated, but not necessarily the same.\n\n\n10.4.1 Footnotes\n[1] ACA health plans that are not subject to risk adjustment are Grandfathered plans, Short-term, limited-duration plans, Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), and plans offered by states that have received a waiver from HHS.\n[2] Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly",

The files, in additional to other resources from CMS, are used to calculate the CMS HCC risk adjustment factor (RAF) scores.\nCMS shares these files through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MARx) system and through the Health Plan Management System (HPMS).\nMAOs can refer to the Plan Communications User Guide (PCUG) for additional details on the files exchanged through the MARx system.\n\n10.7.1 Monthly Membership Detail Report (MMR)\nThe MMRs contain member eligibility, risk scores, and prospective payments the MAO receives for each member in the upcoming month. They also contain retroactive adjustments to prior months’ records. This file contains the data for both Part C and Part D members. The key pieces of data to get from the MMR are:\n\nEligibility: Understanding eligibility is a pre-requisite for modeling risk adjustment. The MMR has very detailed information regarding eligibility, including retrospective enrollments and disenrollment data. Just because a member exists in the MMR file, does not mean that they are eligible and should be included in risk adjustment.\nSegment / Risk Model: Depending on the risk adjustment model being used (most commonly v24 and v28), different co-efficients are used for the member based on if they are newly enrolled, are dual status, and their medicare status code. This information needs to be gathered from the MMR to calculate risk adjustment\nRisk Scores: The MMR will also disclose risk scores for a patient but only for certain time periods (start of the year, mid-year, and final). This can be used to understand funded premium, or validate calculated risk scores.\n\n\n\n10.7.2 MAO-004\nNot all medical claims are eligible for documenting HCCs for medicare risk adjustment. To address this, CMS provides a report called the MAO-004 which will inform Medicare Advantage organizations if a given diagnosis code submitted is eligible for risk adjustment. This file can be helpful for tying out risk score calculations to the MMR.\n\n\n10.7.3 Model Output Report (MOR)\nSimilar to MMRs, the MORs contain a record for each member. That record shows the Hierarchical Condition Codes (HCCs) for each member used by the Risk Adjustment System (RAS) to calculate Part C or Part D risk adjustment factors for each beneficiary. There are two varieties of MORs, for Parts C and D respectively, as each uses different models.\nIn addition to these monthly files, CMS issues “final” MORs once per year with updated information after the year has ended, and planned runout data has been collected.",

Let’s take a look at a table from the 2024 final rule that contains the raw factors related to demographics.\n\n\n\n2024_Final_Rule_Demographics_Table\n\n\n\nThe demographic score for a female patient 76 years of age with partial dual status is 0.485.\nGiven the patient has been originally disabled, they get an additional 0.103.\n\nThe final raw risk from demographics is (0.485 + 0.103) = 0.588\nIf the patient was an end stage renal disease (ESRD) patient, we would use a separate demographics table that uses the ESRD risk adjustment model.\n\n\n10.8.2 Calculate the Disease Score\nThe disease score can be sourced from multiple places, either the MOR or claims data in combination with MAO-004 report. This example will be looking at calculating risk from claims data.\n\n\n\ndisease_score_calculation\n\n\nIn the sample patient, the diagnosis codes for that patient are provided above from claims data. Not all diagnosis are accepted for risk adjustment, so in this example we will say the diagnosis E10.641, (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with hypoglycemia with coma) is not accepted when checking the MAO-004. That leaves two diagnosis of E08.3293 and E13.9. Even though E13.9 is present twice in claims data, having more than one of the same accepted diagnosis code is the same as having a single instance of that diagnosis code being accepted.\nNext we need to cross-reference the diagnosis codes to get the HCCs for the model. The crosswalk between diagnosis codes and HCCs can be found here under “2024 Initial ICD-10 Mappings”.\n\n\n\ndiagnosis_to_hcc_crosswalk_example\n\n\nWhen looking up the two diagnosis codes in the crosswalk, we see they are both valid and map to two HCCs for the 2024 v28 risk adjustment model (37 and 38).\nNext we need to check the hierarchy to drop HCCs that exist within the hierarchy. This hierarchy exists within the announcement document.\n\n\n\nhcc_hierarchy_2024_final_rule\n\n\nBased on this table, we see that HCC-37 is on the left hand side “If the Disease Group is listed in this column…” and on the right hand side “…Then drop the CMS-HCC listed in this column” there is a match on HCC-38. This means that we drop the HCC-38 and are left with a single remaining HCC (HCC-37) for this patient.\nOnce we have our remaining HCCs after the hierarchy is applied, we need to find the score related to HCC-37 for this single patient example. If there was more than one HCC remaining, the values would be summed,\n\n\n\ndisease_coefficients_v28_2024_announcement\n\n\nFor this patient the score is 0.166.\nNext we need to evaluate disease interactions. Since we are left with only a single HCC, disease interactions don’t apply for this specific example patient. However, please see below for the disease interactions that exist within the v28 model. This is also in the announcement document.\n \nFinally, we need to count the number of HCCs remaining after the application of the hierarchy. In this example, we only have a single HCC, so there is no additional score applied.\n\n\n\nhcc_counts_2024_announcement\n\n\n\n\n10.8.3 Bringing it all together\nWe sum both the demographic score and the disease score to get the final raw raf for the patient. (0.588 + 0.166) = 0.754. This score is the raw risk score for the patient. To get the final risk score for a patient, the formula is (raw_risk_score / normalization_factor).\nFor 2024, the CMS-HCC risk adjustment model normalization factor is 1.015 meaning. For medicare advantage organizations, another Coding Pattern Difference Adjustment (aka Coding Intensity Factor CIF) of 5.9% should be applied on top of the normalization factor.\nSo the final risk score for this single patient would be (0.754 / 1.015) * (1 - 0.059) = 0.699\n\n\n10.8.4 But wait! There’s more\nIn the above example, it only looked at the scores and weights for a single risk adjustment model, v28. However, for medicare advantage organizations in the year 2024, final funded risk is not based solely on the outputs of the v28 risk adjustment model. There is a transition period where risk will be determined with a blended model, where 33% of the risk score will be weighted with the v28 model and 67% of the risk score will be weighted with the v24 risk adjustment model.\nWhat does this mean? This means we have to go back and repeat the steps prior to “Bringing it all together” for the v24 risk adjustment model, then apply the 33% and 67% weighting for v28 and v24 risk scores respectively, then apply normalization factor and CIF to get the final risk score for the patient.\n\n\n10.8.5 Additional notes\n\nIn this specific example, this was looking at the risk adjustment model for Medicare Advantage. Different programs and different use cases can use different risk adjustment models.\nDifferent years going forward (2025 and 2026) have different weighting of the v24 vs v28 risk adjustment models.\nThis can all be subject to change if there is new legislation or final rules for 2025 and 2026.\nIn the context of some CMMI programs, the terms of “coding intensity factor” and “normalization factor” can seem to be the same as the Medicare Advantage definitions, but can be derived in different ways specific to that program.\n\n\n\n10.8.6 References\n\nhttps://www.milliman.com/en/insight/medicare-advantage-and-the-encounter-data-processing-system-be-prepared\nhttps://www.cms.gov/files/document/2024-advance-notice-pdf.pdf",
